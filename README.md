# Gene mutation Circular Plot


## Getting Started

In genetics, the mutation rate is the frequency of new mutations in a single gene 
or organism over time.Mutation rates are not constant and are not limited to a 
single type of mutation;there are many different types of mutations. Mutation 
rates are given for specific classesof mutations. Point mutations are a class of
 mutations which are changes to a single base.Missense and Nonsense mutations 
are two subtypes of point mutations. The rate of these types of substitutions
 can be further subdivided into a mutation 
spectrum which describes the influence of the genetic context on the mutation rate

### Installation and load R libraries



    ### Step_1 Downloading R pakchaes

     if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
     install.packages("BiocManager")

     BiocManager::install(c("ggplot2", "pacman", " plotrix", "DMRcate", " circlize","FlowSorted.Blood.450k", " dplyr"))

     ### Step_2 Loading libraries

    library(ggplot2)
    library(plotrix)
    library(circlize)
    library(pacman)
